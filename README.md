This is a remix of the gcode buttons that use cherry switches found here (https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/printer_mods/meteyou/gcode_buttons).

Follow directions on that page for mounting and printing etc.

I have also included an STL of the switch to us in case you are not sure which one to get.
